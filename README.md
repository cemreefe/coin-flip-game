# Coin Flip Game

Client-side, single user coin flip territory-maxxing game

## Inspiration for the game
Inspired by a game we played at school, called _Ã¼lke oyunu_ (lit: country game). This game board is traditionally drawn on a piece of paper, and areas to flip are arbitrarily drawn on map. If the player wins, they gain said area. If the player loses, they lose an equivalent area that is agreed upon based on approximate area equality by both parties. Coin flip is done by either (1) a literal coin flip, (2) based on random page number's last digit when arbitrarily opened, or (3) a makeshift dice with equal number of plus and dash signs made out of an eraser piece which was the preferred method in my social groups.

## Some ways this implementation differs from the country game
The country game is traditionally played in turns, whereas in this game the bot does not get a turn.
The country game is traditionally multiplayer, wherein a play can attack only one player at each turn.
